    <h1>Payphone Lyrics</h1> 

    <p>I'm at a payphone, trying to call home</p> 

    <p>All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)</p> 

    <p>Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong</p> 

    <p>Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)</p> 

    <p>If happy-ever-after's did exist</p> 

    <p>I would still be holding you like this</p> 

    <p>And all those fairytales are full of shit</p> 

    <p>One more stupid love song, I'll be sick (Uh)</p> 

    <p>Now, I'm at a payphone</p> 

    <p>...</p>
